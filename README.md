# jqselector

jqselector helps to build those pesky jq commands in a visual manner.

It supports building commands just for the basic field selection out of a bigger JSON, not the full range of jq's features.

1. Paste your JSON in the top box
1. Select the fields you want from the selection box
1. Copy the jq line

It's just client side, there's no server.
